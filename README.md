# LouisvilleFun1
Code Louisville Project
I have created a menu with some fun activities around town and some basic information about them.  Please run the program and select the menu item you would like to know more about.  
I have created a class and an additional class that inherits from the first.  Created a dictionary, used a LINQ Query and a loop.
